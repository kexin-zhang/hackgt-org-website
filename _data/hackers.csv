Cool hacker,3/02/17 - 3/08/17,"""At HackIllinois, I and three UIUC students created a containerized, cloud-based autograder for PrairieLearn. PrairieLearn is an UIUC open source application that allows the university’s professors to administer homework and exams online, similar to MyMathLab. Previously, it only supported grading multiple choice and short-answer questions, but we made contributions that allow it to autograde full-fledged coding questions. Our autograder runs on Amazon Web Services as a scalable EC2 instance and creates one-time Docker containers for each student submission. Containerization allows us to securely grade malicious student code, while also providing autograder configuration options through the DockerFile. Paired with SQS, we are able to return real-time results to students in a matter of seconds.
Going into HackIllinois, none of us had much experience with autograders or containerization, but the strong mentorship allowed us to learn while still finishing the project in time. Remarkably, the maintainers of PrairieLearn loved our contributions, so they plan to deploy our autograder within the next week! It’s cool to see a hackathon project turn into something that directly benefits the student body at UIUC.""",http://placehold.it/450x450,https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearnHack
